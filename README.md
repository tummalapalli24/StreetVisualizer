# StreetVisualizer
StreetVisualizer is a Python-based project that allows users to generate an ASCII art representation of a city street. It simulates a city block by arranging customizable elements such as buildings, parks, and empty lots. Users define the dimensions (width and height) and visual characteristics of each element, and the program generates a unique street layout using ASCII characters.

By utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the project models street components (e.g., Building, Park, EmptyLot) as classes with customizable attributes like size and appearance. The program is designed to dynamically render the street grid based on user input, providing an interactive way to visualize city spaces in a text-based format. Customizable Street Elements: Users can define buildings, parks, and empty lots with their respective dimensions and symbols. Dynamic ASCII Art Rendering: Automatically generates street layouts in ASCII art based on the specified street element configurations. Recursive Algorithms: Efficiently handles rendering and positioning using recursion. Interactive User Input: Users can input a one-line specification for each street element, which is then processed and rendered.

How It Works:

Users input the specifications of street elements (such as b:5,10,X for a building, p:7,* for a park, etc.). The program calculates the total width and height of the street and generates a visual layout using ASCII characters. The resulting output is printed directly to the terminal or command prompt.
